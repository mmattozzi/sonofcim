I would have used maven but two of the requirements Pircbot and Mallet didn't
seem to be in any maven repos. As such, I've included a shell script that
will download most of the common jars into the lib directory:

./get_dependencies.sh 

Pircbot 1.4.6 can be downloaded from:
http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php

Mallet 2.0-RC3 can be downloaded from:
http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/download.php

Use JDK 1.6.
